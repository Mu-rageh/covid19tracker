# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project: Kenya, USA, and India

## Overview

This project provides a preliminary analysis of COVID-19 data for Kenya, USA, and India. The analysis focuses on key trends in total cases, total deaths, daily new cases, and death rates.

## Objectives

* To analyze and visualize COVID-19 trends for Kenya, USA, and India.
* To compare the progression of the pandemic across the three countries.
* To provide insights into the impact of the pandemic on each country.

## Tools and Libraries Used

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

## Data Source

The data was obtained from the Our World in Data dataset ('owid-covid-latest.csv').

## How to Run/View the Project

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib installed.
3.  Run the Python script (e.g., `python covid_analysis.py`). The script will:
    * Load and process the data.
    * Generate visualizations.
    * Display key findings.

## Insights and Reflections

* The USA has experienced the highest numbers of total cases and deaths among the three countries, followed by India and Kenya.
* All three countries have shown an increasing trend in total cases and deaths over time.
* Daily new cases exhibit significant fluctuations, reflecting the dynamic nature of the pandemic.
* The death rate varies across the countries, potentially influenced by differences in healthcare quality, population demographics, and other factors.
* This analysis provides a basic overview of the COVID-19 situation in the three countries. Further analysis could explore the impact of interventions, vaccination rates, and other variables to provide a more comprehensive understanding.
